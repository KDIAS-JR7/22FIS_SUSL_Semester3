# Four types of risks
1. Strategic risks 📶
2. Hazard risks ☣️
3. Operational risks 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
4. Financial risks 💸
## 1. Strategic Risks 📶
- Associated with **long-term goals and objectives** of an organization.
- These arise **from external factors** that can **impact** an organizations' **strategic direction**.
- Ex -
	Legal changes
	International Agreements
	Supply Chain Management
	Certifications
	Trademark
## 2. Hazard Risks ☣️
- These risks are of two types;
	1. Natural Hazard risks:
		Earthquakes, Floods, Wildfires, Cyclones
	2. Man-made Hazard Risks:
		Chemical spills, Machinery Malfunctions, Cyber attacks
## 3. Operational Risks 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
- Risks related to day-today operations of an organization.
- Ex-
	Supply Chain Interruptions
	Service System
	Compliance with legal requirements
	Information Technology
	Contracts
## 4. Financial Risks 💸
- Risks that can cause financial losses or disrupt an organizations' financial stability.
- Ex-
	Credit Risk 
	Currency Risk 
	Raw material price
	Counterparty risk 
	Interest Rate Risk 
	Weather Risk 
	Liquidity Risk
# Risk Observation & Management Perspectives
## 1. Strategic Observation Perspective 
- observe how the risks are linked to evolution scenarios and internal processes that pursue strategic objectives
- It sets the path for strategic decisions; assessing **how external changes create new risks/ change severity of existing risks** and **identifying risks in internal processes that could keep the organization from achieving its goals.** 
## 2. The corporate governance perspective
- Observe how the company deals with risks to ensure it maintains stakeholders' confidence. 
- It defines the level of risk that stakeholders are willing to accept(Ex: not willing to accept high risk-high reward); allowing top-level management to keep their trust and stay in charge.
## 3.  The financial observation perspective
- Observing **how the company manages risks** might affect its ability to **have enough money available** **(Liquidity)**, both in the short term and the long term.
## 4.  The business observation perspective
- Observing **how the company deals with risks** **might slow down or make it harder for them to be effective and efficient** at managing their processes
# ISO 31000/2009
This Risk Assessment Framework consists of;
1. Risk Identification
2. Analysis
3. Evolution
## 1. Risk Identification 🔎
- The aim is to create a comprehensive list of Risks based on the events that might create, enhance, accelerate,delay, degrade or prevent an organization from achieving its objectives.
- There are Risks in not pursing an opportunity.
- Risks not identified in this phase won't be included in further analysis, so it is important to be sure to include every possible risk.
- Scope - Build a template to record appropriate information about each risk.
### Stages in Risk Identification
#### 1.  Identification of the unfavorable events
- Looking for critical risk areas inside the organization and identifying potential unfavorable events that might result in loses.
#### 2.  Analysis of the hazards associated with the events
- Looking for causes and sources that might give rise to an event. 
	Natural events - Floods, Hail
	Man-made events - explosions, chemical reactions
	Human activities - assessment mistakes , Cyber attacks
#### 3.  Analysis of related contingencies
- The process of identifying the **underlying conditions, situations, or factors** in the operating environment that **create or increase the likelihood** of a specific risk event occurring.[^1]
[^1]: **Contingencies in ISO 31000:2009** are **enabling conditions** and **not mitigation plans.**
#### 4.  Identification of the types of effects of the event 
-  Search the type of potential damage to the enterprise; such as Financial, Reputational or Operational.
### Store Identified Risks 💾
#### 1. Risk scope - details of possible events
- Store risks as a scope.
- Scope contains descriptions of possible events as event, event type, size and number. 
#### 2. Risk nature – Risk classification, time scale of potential impact
Storing risks as;
- Description - Hazard (Bad)/ Opportunity(Good) / Uncertainty
- Determination - Strategic, Operational, Financial 
#### 3. Stakeholders - Expectations
- Storing risks as Stakeholder Expectations
#### 4. Loss Experience - The past
- As previous incidents and the loses that happened because of them.
#### 5.  Risk tolerance, appetite, or attitude
Store risks according to ;
- Loss potential and expected financial impact
- Target for risk control mechanisms and level of performance impact
-  Attitude, appetite, tolerance, limits for the risk
#### 6.  Risk response, treatment, and controls
