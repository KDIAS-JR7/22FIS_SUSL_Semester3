[[Lesson 2]]
# What is Security?
- Security is the quality or state of being secure or free from danger.
- A successful organization should have **multiple layers of Security.** 
# Layers of Security
- Physical security
- Personal security
- Operations security
- Communications security
- Network Security
- Information Security
# Realizing Security
Security can be realized in three main ways.
- Prevention
- Detection
- Reaction
## Prevention 🛡️
This is a proactive approach which includes measures to **prevent** damages to assets form happening.
Ex: Implement Access Control Lists or C- Lists
## Detection ⏰
Measures taken to detect when, how and by whom an asset has been damaged.
Ex: Implement IDS, Review syslog messages
## Reaction 🔨
Measures taken to recover assets or to recover form damages to assets.
Ex: Restore data from backups
# Critical Characteristics of Information
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
- Accuracy
- Authenticity
- Utility
- Possession
## Confidentiality 🔐
- The quality or state of preventing disclosure or exposure to unauthorized individuals or systems.
- This can be achieved through - Encryption, Access Control
## Integrity ⚙️
- The quality or state of being whole, complete, and uncorrupted.
- Hashing algorithms such as MD5 and SHA can be used to make sure that the information hasn't been tampered with during transit.
## Availability⬆️
-  Enables users who need to access information to do so without interference or obstruction and in the required format.
- Information should have a proper balance of security and availability. Too strict security policies can have a negative effect on information availability; while too light security is a vulnerability.
- Availability can be assured through- Redundancy(Data and Hardware), Backups and Load balancing
## Accuracy🎯
- Free from mistake or error and having the value that the end-user expects
- Accuracy can be achieved through - Data validation, Data audit trails and Data Governance Policies
## Authenticity ✨
-  The quality or state of being genuine or original, rather than a reproduction or fabrication.
- Authenticity can be achieved through - Data Origin Authentication, Multi factor Authentication and Digital Signatures and Certificates
## Utility💰
- The quality or state of having **practical value** for an organization's mission, goals, or objectives.
- Information has Utility if it is **fit for its intended use** and contributes to successful business outcomes.
- If the utility value of Information is high it's a valuable asset.
## Possession🖐️
- The **legal and/or physical custody** or **control** over an asset (especially data and physical hardware). 
- It ensures that only **authorized entities** hold, transport, or store the asset.
- This can be ensured through - Physical security, Chain of Custody and Data Loss Prevention(DLP).
# What is Information Security?
- The practice of **protecting information and the systems** that handle it (hardware, software, and storage) from **unauthorized access, modification, or disruption.**
# The CIA Triad of Information Security

# Why is it important to keep data secure?
- Data theft
- Data loss
- Loss of Reputation
- Financial loss
# Securing Components
- A computer can be the **subject** or **object** of an attack.
	- Subject - The computer actively used to carry out the attack.
	- Object - The computer affected by the attack(Victim).
- Ex: In a scenario where a threat actor is attacking a server, the threat actors' computer is the subject while the sever is the object of the attack.
- The **Subject attacks Object. (SAO)**.
# What is Information System Security (ISS)?
- ISS is concerned with protecting Information system assets such as PCs, software, applications, etc.
- In order to secure an IS, one must first determine;
	- Assets to be protected
	- Security Requirements, CIA
	- Threats, Vulnerabilities and Risks
	- Security Policies
	- Security Measures
