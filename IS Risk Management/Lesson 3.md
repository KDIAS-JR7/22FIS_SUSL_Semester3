# Components of Risk and their Interactions
![Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KDIAS-JR7/22FIS_SUSL_Semester3/main/IS%20Risk%20Management%20/risk%20components.png)
- Threat are  POSSIBLE events; either an action or inaction that leads to unwanted, negative situations. [[Lesson 2#Threat(a possibility) ⚠️]]
- Vulnerabilities are weaknesses or environmental factors that increase the probability of an threat being successful.
- The outcome impact is the final negative impact on the asset once the threat exploits a vulnerability to carryout an attack.
# Information Security Risk Assessment / Analysis
- Involves identifying and assessing risks related to CIA of Information systems and resources.
## Why Assess Information Security Risk?
- In order to protect something, one must first **identify**;
1. What to protect(Assets)
2. What to protect from
## An Information Security Function
- The **organizational structure, roles, and processes** established within an entity to **manage, maintain, and continually improve** the organization's information security posture and controls.
- An Information Security Function should be able to use Information Security Risk Assessment to achieve 3 primary objectives.
1. Determine Safeguards to secure IS that store and process information.
2. Allow an organization to comply with internal and external requirements.
3. Make well informed decisions.
## Information Risk Assessments Activities
1. Identify Threats⚠️
2. Identify Vulnerabilities😰
3. Identify Assets💎
4. Identify Impact🔥
5. Identify Likelihood📶
6. Identify Controls👮‍♂️
### 1. Identify Threats⚠️
- Objective - Identify all possible threats to an asset
- Outcome - A list or catalog of threats
### 2. Identify Vulnerabilities😰
If an asset has a vulnerability a threat can exploit, then the risk to that asset is much higher.
- Objective -
	Identify all possible vulnerabilities to an asset that could be exploited by a threat source
- Outcome -
	1. Make a list of **all possible vulnerabilities**.
	2. Make a list of **vulnerabilities that have already been found**.
### 3. Identify Assets💎
- Identify all the valuable assets that have an impact on the CIA of the organizations' Information resources.
- The **most important part** of this activity is **data collection**.
- Objective - Identify all critical assets of the organizational
- Outcome -
	A list of applications, hardware ,software, databases and people
### 4. Identify Impact🔥
- This step is a part of an **impact-likelihood matrix** ; which will return risk ratings.
- This can be done in two main ways;
	1. Quantitative risk assessments
	2. Qualitative risk assessments
#### Quantitative  Risk Assessment
- Uses numerical values to estimate potential losses / impact.
- Provides an **object-data** driven approach.
- **Often used in financial and high risk industries.** 
	1. Three Point Estimate
	2. Decision Tree Analysis
	3. Expected Monetary Value 
	4. Monte Carlo Analysis
#### Qualitative Risk Assessment
- Uses subjective ratings to determine impact.
- Relies on - 
	**Expert Judgement , historical data and Predefined risk matrices**.
- **Suitable for** **organizations without sufficient numerical data**.
	1. Historical Data 
	2. SWOT analysis
	3. Brainstorming
	4. Risk Matrix
	5. Delphi method
	6. Scenario Analysis
- Objective - Produce a measurement for impact
- Outcome - Measurement metrics
### 5. Identify Likelihood📶
- Objective - 
	Assigning a likelihood value for a threat exploiting a vulnerability.
- Outcome - Probability of each risk happening.
### 6. Identify Controls👮‍♂️
- Controls are mechanisms to prevent a threat source from exploiting vulnerabilities.
- They are closely tied to likelihood and affects the probability of a risk happening.
- Objective -
	Identify the controls available for the asset FOR the threat that is being assessed.
- Outcome - Controls for each risk
