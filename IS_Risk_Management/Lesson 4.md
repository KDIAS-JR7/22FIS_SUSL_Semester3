# Information Security Risk Assessment Framework
- An Information security risk assessment framework provides the logical structure or model to guide a user through the process of executing an Information Security Risk Assessment.
- These frameworks won't go into implementation details, but rather focuses on ;
	Foundational concepts related to risk elements
	High-level activities
	Formulas 
	Decision matrices
# Standard / Existing Frameworks
These are Existing structured, repeatable methodologies that organizations can readily adopt. 

| Advantages               | Disadvantages         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Proven and Established   | Lack of Customization |
| Compliance and Standards | Complexity            |
| Best Practices           | Cost                  |
| Resource Efficiency      |                       |
Ex: 
- OCTAVE
- FAIR
- ISO 27005
- NIST SP-800 30
# Custom Frameworks
A set of **risk management policies, standards, and processes** developed and implemented by an organization that are **specifically tailored** to its unique business model, operating environment, regulatory requirements, and risk appetite.

| Advantages                       | Disadvantages             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Tailored to organizational needs | Resource intensive        |
| Flexibility                      | Risk of oversight         |
| Competitive Advantage            | Lack of recognition       |
| Alignment with culture           | Requires Expert Knowledge |

# Choosing the right framework 
- Choosing the right framework depends on the **organizations' specific requirements, industry regulations, risk tolerance, and the level of detail and quantification needed in risk assessments.**
- Some organizations use a **combinations** of these **frameworks** to address **different aspects of their risk management** approach.
- The choice between Standard and Custom should be made after assessing the organizations' goals, resources, risk profile and regulatory requirements.
## Hybrid Approach
- Here, an established framework is taken as the base and a custom framework is built on top of it to make the original framework more suited for the organizations' specific requirements.
- This approach combines the stable, well defined qualities of a standard framework with the customization ability of a custom framework.
