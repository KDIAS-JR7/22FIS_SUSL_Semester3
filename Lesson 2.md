[[Lesson 1  - Introduction to Information Security]]
#  Threat, Vulnerability, Risk and Attack
# Threat(a possibility) ⚠️ 
-  Threats are **POSSIBLE** **events, sources, actions, or inactions**(not doing something) that could **potentially lead to harm of your organizations information security assets.
- Once a threat becomes active, it is considered an attack.
- A threat is a **combination of Threat actions and Threat sources**.
- Threat = Threat Sources + Threat Actions
- **A Threat source** can have **more than one threat action.**
- Ex:
	- Threat source: Hacker
	- Threat action: Unauthorized access
	- Threat: **(Unauthorized access)** by **(Hacker)**
## Types of Threats by Source(Origin)
- Natural Threats 🌪️
	-Floods, Hurricanes or Tornadoes
- Unintentional Threats ❎
	-An employee mistakenly deleting critical data
- Intentional Threats ❌
	-Spyware, Malware, Actions of Black Hat Hackers, Actions of Angry Employees and spies
## Causes of Threats
- User/Human Error
- Natural / Man-made disasters
- Machine Malfunctions
- Angry Insider
- Outsider
## Types of Threats by Effect(CIA compromise)
- Disclosure threat
- Integrity threat
- Denial of Service threat
### Disclosure Threat 
- Dissemination of Unauthorized Information
- Compromises the **Confidentiality** aspect of CIA.
### Integrity Threat 
- Unauthorized modification of Data.
- Compromises the **Integrity** aspect of CIA.
### Denial of Service Threat 
- Access to a system or service is limited or blocked for authorized individuals.
- Compromises the **Availability** aspect of CIA.
# Vulnerability 😰
- A **known weakness** of an asset that **could be exploited by one or more attackers.**
- It is a known issue that **allows an attack to succeed**. 
- Most vulnerabilities are **exploited by automated processes** rather **than with direct human activity.**
- Ex:
	-Weak password, Unencrypted Data
# Attack ⚔️
- **Action** of a malicious (intended to harm) intruder that exploits vulnerabilities of the system to **cause a threat to occur**.
## Types of Attacks 
- Interruption
- Interception
- Modification
- Fabrication
- Denial
### Interruption🛑
- An asset is destroyed, unavailable or unusable.
- Compromise **Availability** aspect of CIA.
- Ex - A Black Hat Hacker carrying out a DDoS attack
### Interception👂
- An unauthorized party **gaining access** to an asset. 
- Compromise **Confidentiality** aspect of CIA.
- Ex - A threat actor carrying out a Man-In-The-Middle attack
### Modification✍️
- Unauthorized party **corrupting an asset**.
- Compromise **Integrity** aspect of CIA.
- Ex - A threat actor modifying an intercepted message.
### Fabrication🎭
- Unauthorized users **insert fake/ false data or objects** into the system.
- Compromise **Integrity** aspect of CIA.
- Ex - A Black Hat Hacker inserting new, false data into a database.
### Denial🗣️
- A person **denies taking** a certain **action**.
- Compromise **Authenticity**.
- Compromise **Integrity** aspect of CIA.
- Ex -  A Scammer denying having sent a Phishing E-mail.
# Risk ⚠️
- The **potential for loss or damage** when a threat exploits a vulnerability.
- **Risk = Threat X Vulnerability**
  Ex -
	- Financial Loss
	- Loss of Privacy
	- Reputational Damage
	- Legal Implications
	- Loss of Life
# Software Risk🚧
- A possibility of suffering loss in the software development process. Such as;
	Production cost
	Poor quality Software
	Not meeting deadlines
# Components  of Risk
- Event 
- Asset
- Outcome
- Probability
## Event 📅
- Always a **future** event.
- It can be an **action** or **not taking an action**.
- The **action/inaction** will have a **direct/indirect influence** on the **outcome**.
- Ex: 
	Using a weak password(action)
	Not using secure methods for data transfer(inaction)
## Asset 💎
- An asset is **anything valuable** within the organization.
- It is the direct or indirect **target of an event.**
- The outcome always have a **direct consequence applied to the asset.**
- Ex: Applications, Databases, Software, Hardware, People
## Outcome💥
- This is the **negative impact** of the event.
- The outcome of a risk is **always unfavorable**.
- This always has a direct effect on part of / the whole asset.
- Ex:
	**$150,000 in recovery costs** (e.g., forensics, system replacement) and **$50,000 in lost revenue** due to downtime. 
## Probability %
- This is the measurement / probability of an event occurring in the future.
- Ex: 
	**Expected Frequency: 2-3 successful interceptions per year** by external actors due to known network vulnerabilities.
